# Handwritten-Digits-Recognizer-2.0

Actually Mousewritten Numbers Recognizer using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) in Python with Keras

This file includes the following chapters:
1. Code Requirements
2. Project description
3. How to install
4. Tips

# 1. Code Requirements:
Python 3.8 with following modules installed:
* Pygame 1.9
* NumPy
* TensorFlow 2.3
* Keras
* OpenCV 4.4 for Python
* Matplotlib

# 2. Project Description:
The project is very simple and intuitive to use. Contains to tools: brush and rubber, which are used to draw on white canvas.
After the drawing is finished, the recognition process starts automatically.
First, the tools from the OpenCV library find contours that can be digits.
Later these contours are converted into inputs for the neural network, which tries to recognize the digits labels.
Finally, the results are combined into numbers that are shown in the decimal, binary, and hexadecimal system.
